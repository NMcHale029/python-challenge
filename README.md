projects requires importing csv and os. PyPoll additionally requires importing statistics

PyBank
main.py reads from a csv vile then prints to terminal and writes to a text file the following:
  The total number of months included in the dataset
  The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
  The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
  The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
  The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

PyPoll
main.py reads from a csv vile then prints to terminal and writes to a text file the following:
  The total number of votes cast
  A complete list of candidates who received votes
  The percentage of votes each candidate won
  The total number of votes each candidate won
  The winner of the election based on popular vote
